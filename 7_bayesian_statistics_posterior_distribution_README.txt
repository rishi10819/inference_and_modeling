Florida is one of the most closely watched states in the U.S. election because it has many electoral votes and the election is generally close. 
Create a table with the poll spread results from Florida taken during the last days before the election. 
Calculate a spread average and provide an estimate of the standard error.

Use the formulas for the posterior distribution to calculate the expected value of the posterior distribution if we set mu=0 and tau=0.01.

----------------------------

Compute the standard error of the posterior distribution.

----------------------------

Using the fact that the posterior distribution is normal, 
create an interval that has a 95% of occurring centered at the posterior expected value. 

----------------------------

According to this analysis, what was the probability that Trump wins Florida?

----------------------------

We had set the prior variance tau to 0.01, reflecting that these races are often close. 
Change the prior variance to include values ranging from 0.005 to 0.05 and 
observe how the probability of Trump winning Florida changes by making a plot.
