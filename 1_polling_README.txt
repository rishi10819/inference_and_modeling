Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion p of voters are Democrats and 1-p are Republicans. 
Your sample size is N=25. 
Consider the random variable S, which is the total number of Democrats in your sample. 

Calculates the standard error se of a sample average when you poll 25 people in the population. 
Generate a sequence of 100 proportions of Democrats p that vary from 0 (no Democrats) to 1 (all Democrats). 
Plot se versus p for the 100 different proportions.

------------------------------

Create a for-loop that generates three plots of p versus se when the sample sizes equal N=25, N=100, and N=1000.

------------------------------

Say the actual proportion of Democratic voters is p=0.45. 
In this case, the Republican party is winning by a relatively large margin of d= -0.1, or a 10% margin of victory. 
What is the standard error of the spread (2 * X-bar - 1) in this case?
