Write function called take_sample that takes the proportion of Democrats p and the sample size N as arguments and 
returns the sample average of Democrats (1) and Republicans (0).
Calculate the sample average if the proportion of Democrats equals 0.45 and the sample size is 100.

-----------------------------

Replicate the random sampling 10,000 times and calculate p - X-bar for each random sample. 
Save these differences as a vector called errors. 
Find the average of errors and plot a histogram of the distribution.

-----------------------------

The error p - X-bar, is a random variable. 
In practice, the error is not observed because we do not know the actual proportion of Democratic voters, p. 
However, we can describe the size of the error by constructing a simulation. 
What is the average size of the error if we define the size by taking the absolute value p - X-bar ?

-----------------------------

Calculate the standard deviation of the spread.

-----------------------------

Estimate the standard error.

-----------------------------

Calculate the standard error of the estimate: approximate SE (X-bar)

-----------------------------

Make a qq-plot of the errors.

-----------------------------

Define the probability that X-bar value will be greater than 0.5.

-----------------------------

Assume you are in a practical situation and you don't know p. 
Take a sample of size N=100 and obtain a sample average of X-bar = 0.51. 
What is the CLT approximation for the probability that your error is equal or larger than 0.01?
