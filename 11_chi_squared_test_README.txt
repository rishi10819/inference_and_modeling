Comparing Proportions of Hits.
Earlier, we determined whether or not each poll predicted the correct winner for their state in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
Each poll was also assigned a grade by the poll aggregator. 
Now we're going to determine if polls rated A- made better predictions than polls rated C-.
Here filter the errors data for just polls with grades A- and C-. 
Calculate the proportion of times each grade of poll predicted the correct winner.

--------------------------------------

We found that the 
A- polls predicted the correct winner about 86% of the time in their states and 
C- polls predicted the correct winner about 80% of the time.

Use a chi-squared test to determine if these proportions are different.

--------------------------------------

Odds Ratio Calculation.
It doesn't look like the grade A- polls performed significantly differently than the grade C- polls in their states.
Calculate the odds ratio to determine the magnitude of the difference in performance between these two grades of polls.
