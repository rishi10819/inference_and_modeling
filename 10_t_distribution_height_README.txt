Sampling From the Normal Distribution.
we take random samples of 50 heights from a distribution of heights. 
Use Monte Carlo simulation, for N = 15. 

---------------------------------

Repeat the previous Monte Carlo simulation using the t-distribution instead of using the normal distribution to construct the confidence intervals.
What are the proportion of 95% confidence intervals that span the actual mean height now?
