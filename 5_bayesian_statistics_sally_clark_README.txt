In 1999 in England Sally Clark was found guilty of the murder of two of her sons. 
Both infants were found dead in the morning, one in 1996 and another in 1998, and she claimed the cause of death was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). 

No evidence of physical harm was found on the two infants.

The rate of SIDS is 1 in 8,500.

Let's assume that there is in fact a genetic component to SIDS and the the probability of 
Pr(second case of SIDS | first case of SIDS) = 1/100.

What is the probability of both of Sally Clark's sons dying of SIDS?

------------------------------------------

Assume that the probability of a murderer finding a way to kill her two children without leaving evidence of physical harm is:
Pr(two children found dead with no evidence of harm | mother is a murderer) = 0.50

Assume that the murder rate among mothers is 1 in 1,000,000. 
Pr(mother is a murderer) = 1/1,000,000

According to Bayes' rule, what is the probability of:
Pr(mother is a murderer | two children found dead with no evidence of harm)
