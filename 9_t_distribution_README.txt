Using the t-Distribution.
We know that, with a normal distribution, only 5% of values are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean. 
Calculate the probability of seeing t-distributed random variables being more than 2 in absolute value when the degrees of freedom are 3.

-----------------------------------

Plotting the t-distribution.
Now use sapply to compute the same probability for degrees of freedom from 3 to 50. 
Make a plot and notice when this probability converges to the normal distribution's 5%.
